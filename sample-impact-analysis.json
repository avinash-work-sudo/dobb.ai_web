  "summary": "The E-commerce Checkout Optimization feature represents a high-impact enhancement that will significantly improve user conversion rates and reduce cart abandonment. This feature requires substantial changes across payment processing, user interface components, and analytics tracking systems. The implementation involves moderate technical complexity with critical dependencies on third-party payment providers and requires careful coordination between frontend, backend, and DevOps teams. Risk assessment indicates medium-level concerns primarily around payment security and data migration strategies.",
